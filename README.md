#INTELLIGENT STREET LIGHT MONITORING AND CONTROLLING SYSTEM

A Smart Street Lights System is a cutting-edge urban lighting solution designed to enhance both security and energy efficiency. This system utilizes advanced sensors to automatically control streetlights. When it detects the presence of a person or vehicle, the lights illuminate, providing safety and visibility. In the absence of activity, the lights dim or turn off, conserving energy and reducing operational costs.

Moreover, for security purposes, this system captures and stores images when activity is detected. These images are securely stored for review and analysis. Additionally, all system data, including activity logs and image storage, is seamlessly transmitted and displayed on the Blynk Cloud platform. This cloud-based monitoring allows for real-time oversight of streetlight operation and security-related activities, empowering city officials to make informed decisions.

In summary, a Smart Street Lights System seamlessly combines motion-sensing technology, energy conservation, and cloud-based monitoring to enhance security, reduce energy consumption, and optimize urban lighting infrastructure. This innovative solution promotes safer streets while providing valuable data and image storage for security and analysis purposes.
